This is a project which I am making to learn web dev.

It is a Laboratory information Software(LIS).Meant for use in my father's Lab right now; though, I probably would upscale, in future.

Features demanded at initial level are:
*storing and retreiving data of patients
*generating rate list for different cases
*generating report in pdf format for sharing through whatsapp web
