This is a project which I was building to learn web dev- basics.


The frontend is currently in HTML,CSS,JS; to view in browser, run signup.html with live server.

To run backend, you need to have LTS version from node.js official website, installed beforehand.

if installed, run "npm install" in terminal.

run "node server.js" to start server.(remember to create ".env" file for yourself)
